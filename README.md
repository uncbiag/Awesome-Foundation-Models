# Awesome-Foundation-Models
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A foundation model is a large-scale pretrained model (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream applications. This term was [first popularized](https://crfm.stanford.edu) by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. This repository maintains a curated list of foundation models for vision and language tasks. Research papers without code are not included.
